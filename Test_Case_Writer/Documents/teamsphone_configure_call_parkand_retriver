Configure Call park and retrieve
In this article
Call park and retrieve lets a user place a call on hold. When a call is parked, the service generates a unique code for call retrieval. The user who parked the call or someone else can then use that code with a supported app or device to retrieve the call. For more information on how your users can park a call, seePark a call in Teams.
Some of the common scenarios for using call park are:
A receptionist parks a call for someone working in a factory. The receptionist then announces the call and the code number over the public address system. The user who the call is for can then pick up a Teams phone on the factory floor and enter the code to retrieve the call.
A user parks a call on a mobile device because the device battery is running out of power. The user can then enter the code to retrieve the call from a Teams desk phone.
A support representative parks a customer call and sends an announcement on a Teams channel for an expert to retrieve the call and help the customer. An expert enters the code in Teams clients to retrieve the call.
To park and retrieve calls, a user must be an Enterprise Voice user and must be included in a call park policy.
By default, the range of call pickup numbers is from 10-99. You can also create your own custom range between 10-9999. The first parked call renders a pickup code of the start of range (for instance 10). The next parked call renders a pickup code incremented by 1, that is, 11, and so on, until the end of the range is rendered as a pickup code. After which, the rendered pickup codes start over from the start of the range once again.
You can specify a timeout as the number of seconds to wait before ringing back when the parked call isn't picked up. The allowed range is 120-1800 seconds, and the default value is 300 seconds.
To configure call park and retrieve, you must be a Teams administrator. Call park and retrieve is turned off by default. You can enable it for users and create user groups by using the call park policy. When you apply the same policy to a set of users, they can park and retrieve calls among themselves.
Note
Call park and retrieve is only available inTeams Only deployment mode. It isn't supported on Skype for Business IP phones.
You can configure call park and retrieve by using the Teams admin center or by using PowerShell.
