Block inbound calls
In this article
Microsoft Calling Plans, Direct Routing, and Operator Connect all support blocking inbound calls from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This feature allows an administrator to define a list of number patterns and exceptions at the tenant global level so that the caller ID of every incoming PSTN call to the tenant can be checked against the list for a match. If a match is made, an incoming call is rejected.
This inbound call blocking feature only works on inbound calls that originate from the PSTN and only works on a tenant global level. Individual Teams users can't manipulate this list. The Teams client does allow individual users to block PSTN calls. For information about how your end users can implement call blocking, seeManage call settings in Teams.
Note
Blocked callers may experience slightly different behaviors when they've been blocked. The behavior is based on how the blocked caller's carrier handles the notification that the call isn't allowed to be successfully completed. Examples may include a carrier message stating the call can't be completed as dialed, or simply dropping the call.
Note that it's currently not possible to manage call blocking by using Teams admin center.
Manage call blocking by using PowerShell
To manage call blocking, you need to define one or more number patterns to block calls from, define exceptions to the number patterns, and enable the call blocking feature.
Number block patterns are defined as regular expression patterns. The order of the expressions is unimportant--the first pattern matched in the list results in the call being blocked. A new number or pattern that's added or removed in the blocked callers list may take up to 24 hours for the pattern to become active.
Activate the call blocking feature
To view and activate the call blocking feature, use theGet-andSet-CsTenantBlockingCallingNumbersTeams PowerShell Module cmdlets.
Get-CsTenantBlockedCallingNumbersreturns the inbound block number patterns and the inbound exempt number patterns parameters for the global blocked number list. This cmdlet also returns whether blocking has been Enabled (True or False).
Set-CsTenantBlockedCallingNumbersallows you to specify whether the global tenant blocked calls are turned on or off at the tenant level.
Manage block number patterns
You manage number patterns by using theNew-,Get-,Set-,Test-, andRemove-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatternTeams PowerShell Module cmdlets.
Get-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatternreturns a list of all blocked number patterns added to the tenant list including Name, Description, Enabled (True/False), and Pattern.
New-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatternadds a blocked number pattern to the tenant list.
Remove-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatternremoves a blocked number pattern from the tenant list.
Set-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatternmodifies one or more parameters of a blocked number pattern in the tenant list.
Test-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatterntests whether calls from a given phone number will be blocked.
Examples
Block a number
In the following example, the tenant administrator wants to block all calls coming from the number range 1 (312) 555-0000 to 1 (312) 555-9999. The number pattern is created so that both numbers in range with + prefixed and numbers in the range without + prefixed are matched. You don't need to include the symbols – and () in the phone numbers because the system strips these symbols before matching.  To turn on the number pattern, set theEnabledparameter to True. To disable this specific number pattern, set the parameter to False.
In the next example, the tenant administrator wants to block all calls coming from the number 1 (412) 555-1234. To turn on the number pattern, theEnabledparameter is set to True.
Creating a new pattern adds the pattern as enabled by default. The description is an optional field to provide more information.
We recommend that you provide a meaningful name to easily understand why the pattern was added. To block spam numbers, consider naming the rule the same as the number pattern that's being matched, and then add additional information in the description as required.
Patterns are matched using Regular Expressions (Regex). For more information, seeUsing Regex.
Allow time for replication before you test and validate.
Allow a number
You can allow a number to call by removing the blocked number pattern. In the following example, the tenant administrator wants to allow 1 (412) 555-1234 to make calls again.
If the identity isn't known, use theGet-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatterncmdlet to first locate the proper pattern and note the identity. Then, run theRemove-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatterncmdlet and pass the appropriate identity value.
Allow time for replication before you test and validate.
View all number patterns
The following cmdlet returns a list of all blocked numbers that are entered for a tenant:
Use built-in PowerShell filtering abilities to parse the returned values as required.
Test whether a number is blocked
To verify whether a number is blocked in the tenant, use theTest-CsInboundBlockedNumberPatterncmdlet.
ThePhoneNumberparameter is required, and should be a numeric string without any extra characters, such as +, - or (). The resultingIsNumberBlockedparameter returns a value of True if the number is blocked in the tenant; the parameter returns False if it's not blocked.
In the following examples, you can see that the phone number 1 (312) 555-8884 is blocked because it's in the blocked range above. The phone number 1 (312) 555-8883 is allowed based on the exemption created below.
Manage number exceptions
You can add exceptions to blocked number patterns by using theNew-,Get-,Set-, andRemove-CsInboundExemptNumberPatterncmdlets.
New-CsInboundExemptNumberPatternadds a number exception pattern to the tenant list.
Get-CsInboundExemptNumberPatternreturns a list of all number exception patterns added to the tenant list.
Set-CsInboundExemptNumberPatternmodifies one or more parameters to a number exception pattern in the tenant list.
Remove-CsInboundExemptNumberPatternremoves a number exception pattern from the tenant list.
Examples
Add a number exception
In the following example, the tenant administrator wants to allow the phone numbers 1 (312) 555-8882 and 1 (312) 555-8883 to make calls to the tenant, even if these two phone numbers are in the range that has been blocked in the example above. To enable this, a new number exception pattern is created as follows:
To turn on the number pattern, theEnabledparameter is set to True. To disable this specific number pattern, set the parameter to False.
View all number exceptions
In this example, theIdentityparameter is optional. If theIdentityparameter isn't specified, this cmdlet returns a list of all number exception patterns entered for a tenant.
Modify a number exception
TheSet-CsInboundExemptNumberPatterncmdlet lets you modify one or more parameters for a given number pattern identity. In this example, theIdentityparameter is required.
Remove a number exception
TheRemove-CsInboundExemptNumberPatterncmdlet will remove the given number pattern from the tenant list. In this example, theIdentityparameter is required.
If the identity isn't known, use theGet-CsInboundExemptNumberPatterncmdlet to first locate the proper pattern and note the identity. Then, run theRemove-CsInboundExemptNumberPatterncmdlet and pass the appropriate identity value. Allow time for replication before you test and validate.
Using Regex
The pattern matching for blocking callers is done by using Regex. Multiple tools are available online to help validate a Regex pattern match. If you aren't familiar with Regex patterns, we recommend that you take some time to familiarize yourself with the basics. To make sure you get expected results, use a tool for validating pattern matches before you add new blocked number matches to your tenant.
