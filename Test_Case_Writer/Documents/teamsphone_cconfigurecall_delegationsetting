Configure call forwarding and delegation settings
In this article
This article describes how you, the administrator, can change call forwarding and delegation settings for your users. You might want to change these settings, for example, if:
You can use the Teams admin center or Teams PowerShell cmdlets to view and change call settings for users.
To set call settings for a user, the user must have an assigned Microsoft Teams Phone license.
Use the Teams admin center
You can use the Teams admin center to configure call forward and unanswered settings, group call pickup, and call delegation for your users.
To configure immediate call forward settings:
In the Teams admin center, go toUsers>Manage usersand select a user.
On the user details page, go to theVoicetab.
UnderCall answering rules, selectBe immediately forwarded, and select the appropriate call forward type and destination.
To configure simultaneous ringing, on the same page selectRing the user's devices. In theAlso allowdrop-down, select the appropriate simultaneous ringing setting.Call forwarding and simultaneous ringing to people in organizationorCall forwarding and simultaneous ringing to external phone numbersinVoice>Calling policiesmust be turned on for this call forward type and destination to be available. These settings are on by default.
To configure unanswered settings, on the same page select the appropriate setting in theIf unanswereddrop-down. In theRing for this many seconds before redirectingdrop-down, specify the number of seconds to wait.
The configuration of call delegation and group call pickup is integrated into the call forward and unanswered settings by selecting the appropriate type. For example, to configure calls to also ring the user's delegates, on the same page selectCall delegationunderAlso allow. Then add the appropriate delegates by selectingAdd peopleand selectingSave. For more information, seeCall sharing and group call pickup.
realted to Team admin center voice setting:
change users' voice settings
in the Microsoft Teams admin center
to configure outbound calling
and call answering rules
To get started, open the
Microsoft Teams admin center
at admin.teams.microsoft.com.
Then, select "Users,"
followed by "Manage users."
This grid shows a list of active
users in your organization.
Next, select the user you want to manage--
in this case, Adele Vance.
Below the tiles at the top of the page,
select "Voice" to see the
user's voice settings.
First, you can configure outbound calling.
The default is "Any
destination," but you can choose
"In the same country or
region" as the organizer
to restrict users to domestic calling
or "Don't allow" to prevent
outbound calling all together.
Second, you can configure
call answering rules.
The default is to ring the user's devices.
And you can choose a second action,
like "Simultaneously ring a user,"
"Simultaneously ring a
number," "Call delegation,"
or "Group call pickup."
Additionally, you have the
option to select what happens
if the user doesn't answer
after the specified period.
Those include voicemail,
"Forward to a person,"
"Forward to a number,"
"Group call pickup,"
and "Call delegation."
When you're finished configuring
the user's voice settings,
select "Save" to save your work.
The user will now experience
these new outbound calling
and call-answering rules.

Use PowerShell
You can use PowerShell to configure call forward and delegation settings for your users.  You use the following cmdlets, which are available in Teams PowerShell module version 4.0 or later:
Display call forward and delegation settings for a user

The output shows that user1 has simultaneous ringing to delegates configured. Unanswered calls are sent to voicemail after 20 seconds. User2 is defined as the delegate with all delegate permissions.
Set call forward settings for a user
To forward all calls for user1 to user2, use the Set-CsUserCallingSettings cmdlet, as shown in the following example:
To simultaneously ring all delegates for user3, use the Set-CsUserCallingSettings cmdlet, as shown in the following example:
The following example uses the Set-CsUserCallingSettings cmdlet to configure a call group for user4 with user5 and user6 as members. All calls to members of the group are forwarded in the order they're defined:
For more examples, seeSet-CsUserCallingSettings.
Add a calling delegate for a user
To add user2 as a delegate for user1 with all permissions allowed, use the New-CsUserCallingDelegate cmdlet, as shown in the following example:
Change calling delegate permissions

Diagnosing issues with Call Forwarding
If youï¿½re an administrator, you can use the following diagnostic tool to validate that a user is properly configured to forward calls received in Teams to a specific number.
SelectRun Testsbelow to populate the diagnostic in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
Run Tests: Teams Call Forwarding
In the Run diagnostic pane, enter the email of the user who's having issues forwarding calls in theUsername or Emailfield. Enter the phone number (in E.164 format) that the user wants calls to be forwarded to and then selectRun Tests.
The tests will return the best next steps to address any user settings or configurations to validate that the user is properly configured to forward calls to a specific number in Teams.
Additional notes
For a user whose call answering rules haven't been modified either by the user or a tenant admin, unanswered calls are forwarded to voicemail after 30 seconds by default. The settings displayed for the user in Teams admin center or Teams PowerShell show the unanswered target as none and a delay of 20 seconds.
