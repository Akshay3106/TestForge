## Navigations

         ## UI
         Screen with navigation bar identified as calling and down in body options available like call forwarding, forward to, advance calling, Hotline.
     2)Tapping on Hotline will show the Hotline settings screen
         ## UI
         Screen with navigation bar identified as 'Hotline' ,in right corner of it there is buttom to 'continue' and in body it has options like Hotline enable disable button and below it has option like 'add configured number' this option has one instruction saying The configured number auto-dial while user pick up the phone.
     Since you haven’t configured any number / contacts yet, you’ll see Add configured number but will 
     change when you do have it configured to a PSTN number or a contact is chosen. 
     3) Tapping on Add configured number will show a dialog to configure the hotline feature.
        ## UI

      You can also enter a different displayed name if you want to specify a specific name to display 
      Tapping on save will go through validation on whether it succeeded or failed. 
      If configured properly, you’ll see the Hotline settings screen updated with the entered information.

## Important notes
     The “Continue” button will always be enabled unless Hotline toggle is on but no Hotline contact is 
     entered 
     The Hotline information entered are stored into the user’s preferences meaning if the user logs out, 
     all this information will be reset but do persist if the device is restarted.  
     4) Tapping on Continue will show this dialog letting the user know the configurations will be take place 
     after restarting the app
        ## UI
        Screen shows one box with dialog "You'll need to restart to apply changes" and provides two options 'cancel' and 'restart',
     5)  If the Hotline toggle was on and the Hotline contact  was configured properly, the Hotline home 
     screen will show up.

     6) From this home screen, picking up the phone receiver or turning the speaker on will make a call to the 
     preconfigured Hotline contact.
         ## UI

## Known Bugs
     1)Underline missing for the number input.
     2)Text alignment, styling etc.
     3)After restarting turning off Hotline toggle and restarting user in CAP mode, top bar is missing so 
     user cannot access settings. 
     4)Turning off speaker doesn’t terminate call.
     5)Contact picker 
         We’re using the same contact picker that’s used throughout the app and there are 
         existing issues which will also affect Hotline 
         5.1) Can’t find a contact error image taking up more space than available and also cut off at the top 
         due to alignment 
         5.2) Shows contact in groups.  “i.e. Directory contacts” – due to limited horizontal space it’s not very ideal for Hotline
