The call sharing and group call pickup features of Microsoft Teams let users share their incoming calls with colleagues so that the colleagues can answer calls that occur while the user is unavailable.
Group call pickup is less disruptive to recipients than other forms of call sharing because users can configure how they want to be notified of an incoming shared call, and they can decide whether to answer it. The order in which members of the call group are notified about the incoming call can be specified as simultaneous or in order (with 5 or less members).
Important
Users, the call group owner, and members of the call group must be in Teams Only deployment mode. For more details on Teams deployment modes, seeUnderstand Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability.
License required
Users must be assigned a Microsoft Teams Phone license to set up and use call sharing and group call pickup. For additional details on the licensing model, seeHere's what you get with Teams Phone.
Limitations
A user can only be the owner of one call group. Each configured call group can have a maximum of 25 users or 32,768 characters. A user can be a member of maximum 25 call groups.
Note that mobile devices will only get notified if they're set for banner and ringtone.
Enable the use of group call pickup
You enable call groups by configuring theTeamsCallingPolicy AllowCallGroupssetting for a user. You can use Teams admin center or PowerShell. When enabled, the user can configure their call groups in the Teams client.
Important
When you turn off call groups for users, you must clean up the call group relationships for users in the Teams admin center to avoid incorrect call routing.
