Manage caller ID for users
In this article
This article is for administrators and IT professionals who manage caller ID settings for their users. As an administrator, you can:
Caller ID consists of two user-facing pieces of information:
Important
Emergency calls always send the user's telephone number (caller ID) to a public-safety answering point (PSAP). For more information on emergency calls, seePlan and manage emergency calling.
For more information, seeMore about Calling Line ID and Calling Party Name.
Outbound caller ID options
For the outbound PSTN caller ID, the following options are available:
The telephone number assigned to the user, which is the default.
Anonymous, which is available by removing the presentation of the userâ€™s PSTN number.
A substitute phone number, which can be one of the following:
A telephone number through Operator Connect or Direct Routing that is assigned to a resource account used by a Teams Auto attendant or Call queue.
A telephone number that is classified as a service and toll-free number in your Calling Plans telephone number inventory. The number is assigned to a resource account used by a Teams Auto attendant or Call queue.
Note
The use of CallingIDSubstitute = Service has been deprecated. You're no longer able to create new caller ID policies using CallingIDSubstitute = Service. Existing caller ID policies with CallingIDSubstitute = Service aren't being honored. Use CallingIDSubstitute = Resource instead. For more information, seeSet-CsCallingLineIdentity.
The Calling Party Name or CNAM set on the outbound PSTN call.
For example, when a user makes a call, you can change the caller ID to display your organization's main phone number and company name instead of the user's phone number.
The CNAM can have a maximum of 200 characters, but downstream systems might support fewer characters.
The CNAM is sent on calls where the caller ID is substituted with LineURI, a resource account or service phone number, and when the caller is a Teams user.
End user control that overrides the caller ID policy.
The parameter EnableUserOverride has precedence over other settings in theCallingLineIdentitypolicy.
For example, assume a policy instance has substitution enabled with a resource account and EnableUserOverride is set and enabled by the user. In this case, the outbound caller ID is blocked and Anonymous is used.
You can't assign the following types of phone numbers for the outbound caller ID:
Any phone numbers that are classified as a user in your Calling Plan or Operator Connect's telephone number inventory.
Any on-premises telephone number through Direct Routing that is assigned to a user.
A Skype for Business Server on-premises telephone number.
For Direct Routing, the phone number substitution and the CNAM are sent in theFromSession Information Protocol (SIP) header. If the correspondingOnlinePstnGatewaypolicy is configured with-ForwardPai $true, the P-Asserted-Identity (PAI) SIP header contains the real calling user.
For more information, seeConfigure caller ID policies.
Inbound caller ID options
Teams Phone shows the incoming external phone number as the caller ID. If the number is associated with a user or contact in Microsoft Entra ID or a personal contact, the Skype for Business and Teams clients show the caller ID based on that information. If the phone number isn't in Microsoft Entra ID or a personal contact, the telco-provided display name is shown if it's available.
TheBlock incoming caller IDsetting allows for blocking the caller ID on incoming PSTN calls. You can turn on this setting, but it isn't available to your end users on the user settings page. When this setting is turned on, the incoming PSTN caller is shown as coming from Anonymous.
For more information, seeconfigure caller ID policies.
Configure caller ID policies
You can control caller ID for both inbound and outbound calls. With caller ID settings turned off, the Teams user's phone number is visible when that user makes a call to the PSTN. Likewise, when a PSTN caller makes a call to a Teams user, the PSTN caller's phone number is visible.
By default, the following caller ID settings areturned off.
You can configure caller ID policies by using theTeams admin centeror by usingPowerShell.
Use the Teams admin center
You manage caller ID policies by going toVoice>Caller ID policiesin the Microsoft Teams admin center. You can use the global (Org-wide default) policy or create and assign custom policies. Users in your organization automatically get the global policy unless you create and assign a custom policy.
For more information on each policy, seeconfigure caller ID policies.
Create a custom caller ID policy
In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go toVoice>Caller ID policies.
SelectAdd.
Enter a name and description for the policy.
Turn on or offBlock incoming caller IDandOverride the caller ID policy.

Anonymous:Display the caller ID as Anonymous.
Resource account:Set a resource account associated with an Auto Attendant or Call Queue.
If you chooseResource account, you're prompted to specify a resource account for the next field, calledReplace the caller ID with this resource account. Only resource accounts with an assigned phone number will be displayed. If you just assigned a phone number to the resource account, it might take a few minutes before the resource account is available for selection.
SelectSave.
Assign a custom caller ID policy to users
You can assign a policy directly to users, either individually or at scale through a batch assignment (if supported for the policy type), or to a group that the users are members of (if supported for the policy type).
To learn about the different ways that you can assign policies to users, seeAssign policies to your users in Teams.
Edit a caller ID policy
You can edit the global policy or any custom policies that you create.
In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go toVoice>Caller ID policies.
Select the policy by clicking to the left of the policy name, and then selectEdit.
Change the settings that you want, and then selectSave.
