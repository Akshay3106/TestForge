Shared line appearance in Microsoft Teams
In this article
Shared line appearance lets a user choose a delegate to answer or handle calls on their behalf. This feature is helpful if a user has an administrative assistant who regularly handles the user's calls. In the context of shared line appearance, a manager is someone who authorizes a delegate to make or receive calls on their behalf. A delegate can make or receive calls on behalf of the delegator.
Important
This feature is only in Teams Only deployment mode. For more information on Teams deployment modes, seeUnderstand Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability
Dialing Permissions and Routing
When a delegate makes an outbound PSTN call on behalf of a delegator, the delegator's settings control the checks for appropriate licensing, dial-out restrictions, and call routing.
License required
Managers and delegates must have a Teams Phone license. Managers must have a phone number assigned, PSTN connectivity, and a required license for PSTN connectivity: Calling Plan, Operator Connect, or Direct Routing. The shared line experience is part of delegation and is included with Teams Phone. For more information on licensing, seeMicrosoft Teams service description.
Note
A delegate without a phone number assigned must be EnterpriseVoiceEnabled using the Teams PowerShell cmdlet Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity <user> -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled $true, seeSet-CsPhoneNumberAssignment. If a Dial Pad shows in the Calls App of the Delegate, they are correctly configured for Enterprise Voice.
Shared line appearance feature availability
The following apps and devices currently support shared line appearance:
Limitations
Managers can add up to 25 delegates, and delegates can have up to 25 managers. There's no limit to the number of delegation relationships that can be created in a tenant.
If the delegator and delegate aren't in the same geographic location, the PSTN provider must allow caller ID to show up from a different geographic location for a delegated call.
Circular delegation configuration isn't permitted. If the delegated users also have delegations between them, they'll only be able to see their delegation and not the initial delegation.
Enable delegation and shared line appearance
You enable delegation by using theTeamsCallingPolicy AllowDelegationsetting. You can use Teams admin center or Teams PowerShell. This setting is turned on by default.
When enabled, the end user can configure their delegation relationships directly in Teams.
Important
When you turn off delegation for a user, you also need to clean up delegation relationships for that user in the Teams admin center to avoid incorrect call routing.
Use Teams admin center
To configure delegation and shared line appearance:
In the navigation menu of the Microsoft Teams admin center, selectVoice>Calling policies.
Choose the policy you would like to update or selectAddto create a new policy.
ToggleDelegation for inbound and outbound callson.
SelectSave.
Use PowerShell
To configure delegation and shared line appearance by using Teams PowerShell, use the following cmdlets:
New-CsUserCallingDelegate
Set-CsUserCallingDelegate
Remove-CsUserCallingDelegate
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment
Examples
In the following example, user2@contoso.com is added as a delegate of user1@contoso.com with permissions to make and receive call on behalf of user1, and to change settings for other delegates:
In the next example, delegate user2@contoso.com isn't allowed to make calls anymore on behalf of user1:
In the next example, user2@contoso.com is removed as a delegate of user1@contoso.com:
